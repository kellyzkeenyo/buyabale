# buyabale

The Cause-To reconnect with friends and family using portals purchased through buyabale.

Each bale purchased receives a portal that allows the user to provide internet to their registered communities. 

When stationed the portal will send a signal out to the users advising them of the email address to register their interest to.

This email will be run/monitored/actioned by the baleowner and archived by the co-ordinator.

The baleowner must submit a homepage for their portals website. This can be in the way of a form, app, poster or facebook page with a shop now button.

Once the page/app has been named with our logo in transparent form displayed and the start up cost for the portal of $95 installation and $95 months by month contract is paid to paypal acc (to be advised) a technician will make contact with the available dates he has.
